                    Story 1: 13<br>
                    <span class="more">The year was 1978 and a boy named Caleb was sitting in the back of his math class going through a normal day at Torrent High School. The teacher was talking, he was somewhat listening, and the sun was glowing nicely. When suddenly he looked out the window and noticed the sky had turned a dark red and when he looked back into the room everyone was staring at him with twisted and disturbing smiles.  He was very confused but didn’t say anything, thinking it was all just a prank he didn’t want to fall into.  
                        Suddenly, all of them got up and proceeded to walk towards him, slowly, ever so slowly. He didn’t think it was a prank anymore and grabbed a pencil off his desk to use as a weapon.  The creatures that were once his classmates kept on approaching him and keeping a cold dead stare as their smiles twisted to a point it wasn’t even a human smile anymore.  Caleb was scared as he picked up his backpack to use as a shield of sorts to get the hell out of there.  
                        Just then, as suddenly as they approached him, they stopped.  All of these twisted creatures kept their stare as one of them had picked up a backpack and continued its push towards Caleb.  Caleb kicked out the thing’s knee and jammed the pencil right through its right eye causing a green goop to spray everywhere.  1.  
                        One of the other creatures started cackling as it sprinted towards Caleb. Caleb threw his backpack as hard as he could at the sprinter causing it to go flying backwards into 2 others, crushing them hard enough to hear multiple cracks.  When the sprinter crushed the 2 others, it continued to fly back and smash it’s head into the wall, killing it instantly.  4. 
                        Caleb was left weaponless and 3 of the creatures charged at him while some of the others ran away.  Interesting.  Caleb dropped to the floor and watched the creatures crash into each other knocking 2 of them out and leaving the last one injured.  7.  
                        Caleb, in need of a weapon, broke off one of the legs of a desk and held it like a baseball bat.  He ran up and bashed a creature’s head in, repeatedly.  8. 
                        He then hurled the desk leg like a spear, piercing through another creature’s eye.  He then tripped another creature, stomping its head until it turned to mush.  Another creature grabbed Caleb from behind causing Caleb to fling his body around, knocking into another causing all three of them to fall over, crushing the one that got pushed over. 11. 
                        He got out of the creature’s grip, mounting it and punching its head repeatedly until its face was heavily disfigured.  Caleb stood up and another creature pushed him over, his head got slammed into a desk causing Caleb to knock out.  He woke up in a hospital, scared out of his mind.  He saw the doctor working on his computer and didn’t say anything, thinking it was another one of those creatures.  The doctor turned around and looked normal.  Caleb, still terrified, asked why he was in the hospital.  The doctor, not knowing what Caleb had just gone through, said that he took a nasty fall that seemed to have knocked him out instantly.  
                        Just then a police officer walked in to check on both of them and noticing Caleb was awake decided to stay in the room.  The officer asked Caleb why he did it. Caleb, obviously confused, questioned the officer about what he meant.  The officer said in a calm voice that Caleb had killed 4 of his classmates and injured 8.  Caleb, still confused, said that he didn’t kill any of his classmates and explained that what he did was in both self defense and what attacked him wasn’t even human. 
                        The officer showed a video of the class during that time, showing the slaughter of Caleb’s classmates. He explained what he saw and no one believed him.  Caleb was sent to prison for the rest of his life with no bail.  
                        A few months had passed since the massacre at Torrent High School and more research was done into the case.  The police eventually pieced together that Caleb’s behavior matched closely with symptoms of schizophrenia.  However, by the time they were going to release him, Caleb had already hanged himself in his cell. 13.

        Story 2: Jaime<br>
        <span class="more">An australian man by the name of Jamie finds a man named Rod and is trying to convince Rod to get in his white van that has candy and wifi. Rod is 27 and Jamie is 22. Rod keeps denying it and eventually caves in going into Jamie's van and the door being slammed shut. Jaime offers to take Rod back to Rod's house and they start driving off to a point that Rod wants him to stop at since he wants to not let a stranger know where he lives. They get personal about how their job life was and they both were unemployed due to being fired over shit they didn't do and then Jamie goes into a story about how he was kidnapped and beaten by some men who were looking for money since they were loan sharks and used Jamie as ransom. The father and an Australian man find Jamie and get him out of the torture house he was in. The Australian man got shot and killed by the sharks and Jamie moved to Florida for some time before moving back to the state he was originally in, where he got kidnapped. Father died of a gunshot wound but not from the sharks surprisingly. Jaime, 18 now, went on with his life helping those he could by giving them free rides to wherever they wanted to go, leading to the point where they are now. Jaime and Rod arrive at the spot, Rod tries to pay Jaime for the ride and Jaime denies it. Rod says that he has a son named James with an Australian accent, due to his wife being australian who died during James' birth. Jaime stares at Rod and tells him that he needs to get back home now and get to his son before he gets taken like Jaime did. Turns out, the loan sharks target families with Australian kids and will get the kid no matter what and they need to get to Rod's house ASAP. They go and realize that the house was broken into and James was gone. Rod grabbed a couple guns, gave one to Jaime and said, "Will you help me go after these sons of bitches?" Jaime agrees and they set out. Turns out Jaime lived on that road and was taken in a similar way so he knew where the sharks were and they went for revenge. Well Rod wanted revenge and Jaime didn't want another soul to experience what he did at that age, by the same people, so technically also revenge in a different way. They arrived at the shark house and shot the guards at the door without hesitating. Broke in, killed more guards, and found James in a chair with a bag over his head looking scared but completely unharmed. They tried to leave but Jamie got shot in the back being instantly brought to the floor. The guard that shot Jamie got a full mag dumped into him by Rod and his head caved in by Rod's foot. Rod held Jaime and tried to patch him up. Jaime knew this was going to happen and told Rod he can break the loop as long as he doesn't go to Florida with James. Jaime dies and Rod loses it killing everyone he saw in the building and getting out with James. They move to California and something ruptures causing the cycle to break. The story ends with the sharks dead and everyone living happily until something happens...but we'll save that for another story.

        Story 3: Ledger<br>
        <span class="more">A boy by the name of James Ledger was sitting in the basement of his friend’s house talking and playing the night away.  It was essentially like a party went down and as the night progressed, so did the amount of people leaving until there were about 5 of them left. Those that remained at the party were Abby, Tyler, Nate, Jessica, and obviously James. They were all sitting around talking and doing stupid things that typical late high school students do. Turns out James had a crush on Abby and he just so happened to be sitting by her, on the floor.  She put her hand on the floor and James, trying to be sly, put his hand on hers. Abby pulled her hand away quickly, revealing a slash across her hand that wasn’t there before. Abby panicked a bit as to how the cut got there, Nate went to get peroxide and dish rag to clean and bandage it up, and the rest of them were left confused, until everyone looked at James. James wasn’t a normal person, he was a person who was infused with a virus to turn him into a monster, but he was able to control it. The monster side started to slip out, his arm becoming an amalgamation of thick strings that each looked like muscles, and his fingers were changed into kitchen knife sized blades that could bend like real fingers. Once he realized what everyone was staring at, he didn’t seem angry but more… calm than usual.  He said in a calm and collected voice, “You guys think I’m a monster don’t you? Well, you’d be right, I am a monster, a monster that is part human. I never wanted anyone to see this but… I guess accidents happen every now and again, right?” Everyone just stared at him in fear, except for Abby, who seemed to be understanding, in a way. She was still panicked but felt calmer believing something the others don’t, that James wouldn’t intentionally hurt them.  Just then a crash came from the 1st floor and Nate getting thrown down the stairs into a wall, knocking him out.  Silence was all that could be heard until, thump, thump, thump. The noise the stairs made was terrifying to the group as they knew someone was coming down them, in a slow, steady pace.  Tyler shouted, “Who are you!? What do you want from us!?” Thump, thump, thump. A shadow of a man appeared at the bottom of the stairs, a shadow no one could recognise, except for James. James whispered to the others, “Hide, find somewhere to hide and find it fast.” They all scattered, except for James, who stood up, prepared for what was going to happen. The thumps from the stairs stopped as the man had reached the bottom and turned to stare daggers into James.  “Hello Ledger.” The man said, calm and threatening, “Funny to see you here with all these humans, I thought you gave up trying to live a normal life?” “No, I never did,” James replied, “I said that to get you off my ass and hopefully never look for me again.” The man stood there for a second staring at James until James eventually turned around to face the person who made him a monster. “What do you want from me?” James said, breaking the silence. The man replied, “Oh, nothing. Just wanted to see how my… favorite subject is doing, living a… normal life.” “It’s been nice not having to worry about you coming up and killing me if I disobeyed you.” “I never wanted this you know, I’ve wanted to live a normal life ever since I got these powers, but I couldn’t be the only one to be forced to live in this world as a monster.” “So why me?” “Why you? Well… I chose you since you were just a boy. I wanted someone to experience what I felt as a boy, having to go through hell trying to keep my secret hidden. Trying to not get caught by scientists who wanted to torture me and use me as their own fucking puppet! Having to live without people who I used to trust, my family. I saw potential in you, I saw the potential for someone to have a stronger will than I did! Someone to evolve and keep these powers a secret, unlike I could.” “So you chose me, because you thought I could make a generation that could keep all this a secret? What is your goal, why do you want to have people like us to run around?”  “Humanity is failing, Ledger! We are the only people right now that can change the world! We need to change the world and everyone who lives on it. All I need is for you to help me.” “That would mean killing the people that I trusted wouldn’t it?” “Well, you could infect them and hope that they are as strong willed as you are. You can change them into us or kill them outright.” “I won’t hurt them Mercer, I won’t touch them, and if you do… I will kill you personally.” “Ledger, we are invincible, you know you can’t kill me, so why try to save these pathetic humans when we can reign supreme!” “I know one way to kill you, and I will do it to save these ‘pathetic’ humans.”  Mercer begins to laugh uncontrollably, thinking that James won’t be able to hurt him. However as he’s laughing James grabs his head and slams him into the concrete floor, shattering the floor to pieces. “Get out of here, NOW!” Mercer’s head is exploded into the floor and as everyone is running out of the building, Jessica gets grabbed and tendrils emerge from Mercer’s body, consuming her and restoring Mercer’s head. “That was funny Ledger, too bad I can’t laugh without a head. I can keep doing this all day man, I’ll just keep eating your friends.”  “Which is why I’m putting an end to your sorry ass.” Mercer chuckles and charges Ledger throwing him into the wall breaking it to pieces. Ledger gets up and uppercuts Mercer through the building causing the fight to continue outside. Ledger jumps up, changing his arms into claws and tearing shreds into Mercer. Mercer changes his arms into giant blocks absorbing Ledger’s strikes, causing no damage to Mercer. Mercer then changes his right arm into a giant blade and stabs Ledger through the stomach. Mercer picks up Ledger with the blade and Ledger sends out tendrils from the wound, going down Mercer’s arm circling a ring around his arm cutting it off clean. As Mercer starts to regenerate his arm, Ledger changes his arm into a serrated tendril, metal whip sweeping ahead of him, chopping Mercer in half from the waist.  Ledger then walks up to Mercer and proceeds to beat Mercer into a stain on the pavement as tendrils emerge from his body to consume Mercer.  As Mercer is getting consumed, he says one final line, “You will regret this, do you not realize what you’ve done!” “I know exactly what I’ve done, I’ve stopped a mass murderer from killing the rest of the people I trusted.” Mercer screams as he gets consumed by Ledger.  James proceeds to fall to the floor exhausted from the fight as he sees all the memories of Mercer and all the people he consumed.  He wakes up hours later back in the basement everything around him fixed.  He thinks everything that happened was a dream but then he sees the cut on Abby’s hand and both Jessica and Nate are gone. “What the hell happened? How is everything fixed?” Abby walks over to James and says, “I don’t know how everything got fixed, but what did he mean when he said we can be just like you guys?” “Well… I can infect you with the same virus I was infected with, if you’re strong willed, you will survive and become someone like me, if you aren’t then you’ll die.” “That’s a risk I’m willing to take.” “No, I can’t lose you, I’ve already lost my parents to this virus, I can’t lose the last person I care about.” “James, trust me I’ve got this.” After a bit more back and forth between them, James finally was convinced she won’t die from it. He grabbed her neck to hold her still and turned his hand into a needle to inject her with the virus. The needle went in, he let go and Abby started spasming out of control, exactly how he did when he was injected.  After 10 minutes of spasms, she stopped. She woke up in a panicked state and James went to hug her and calm her down, she was alive and now could be exactly like him. James finally worked up the courage to kiss her and she accepted it, they started dating and went on with their school lives as normal.  They went through the rest of high school without a care in the world, graduated, and continued with their lives together until Tyler calls them years after high school to tell them that he needs help. James and Abby decide to go help their long time friend but that’s a story for another day.
